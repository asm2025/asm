The work in this folder tree "Nager" and its subfolders are not mine.
I needed the functionality and had a similar idea to make a SQLite database
which can be updated on demand or periodically in the asm.Data project but 
there is no need to reinvent the wheel since someone already has done it.
Unfortunately, There is a problem running this from nuget packages because 
apparently it's not configured to have strong assembly name. Since I don't
have the time to debug the issue, I'll just use it for now as a copy. The 
license of this code is included in LICENSE.md which can also be founded on 
the website https://github.com/nager/Nager.PublicSuffix. Maybe later I can 
check it again and preferably remove the folder and use the nuget package if
a fix is available for this.
